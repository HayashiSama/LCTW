              Over 35 years of experience as a nurse, Missionary Chelette
              has worked in various hospitals and homes caring for people.
              In 1998 she worked at ESO as an AIDS Peer Health Educator,
              educating Junior High school students in the Bay Area about
              abstinence STD/HIV Prevention.

          <p className="lead">
              Missionary Chelette also worked at the Southside San Jose Boys
              & Girls Club of America as Asst. Director facilitating groups,
              such as Smart Girls and Passport to Manhood, which educated

              In 2001 she founded Youth On The Rising Outreach, a non-profit

          <p className="lead">
              On December 18, 2012, Missionary Chelette had an accident at
              the Cheesecake Factory, which changed her whole life. It's
              only the Grace of God and the love she has for Jesus and all
              people that keep her going. Not wanting to give up when her
              spirit was down, she would "Cry-Out" to Jesus praying every
              step of the way. Which Our Father International Prayer-line
              Outreach Ministries, which is now OFIPL Ministries, was
              Founded February 04, 2013. After a doctor said she was unable
              to work, go to school or drive until her eye condition changes
              and referred her to the social workers office. She did not
              know where to turn for help. She was referred to the Santa
              Clara Valley Blind Center, which she started attending in
              October 2013. Although she was in denial about her vision
              loss, she knew she needed help. This was the start of the best
              help she needed, which lead her to the Orientation Center for
              the Blind. She stayed on the campus for 6 mouth. She started
              OCB on September 01, 2015 and completed February 26, 2016. She
              learned training in mobility, cooking, ALD, DLS, & technology
              from teachers, (who were totally blind) with their Masters
              Degrees. While at OCB she still managed to Pastor OFIPL
              Ministries, host the prayer lines, run the Greater Greater
              Works revival, "LIVE PRAYER" and more.

          <p className="lead">
              This helped her to regain her independent lifestyle and
              motivated her to start the non-profit organization Love
